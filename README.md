# weekly-meal-planner

Who doesn't struggle to figure out what to eat each and every meal? Unless you're having braeakfast for dinner...again...cause that one is a no brainer! 

But for many people, the struggle is real when deciding what to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday of our lives. This chore becomes even worse when you take eating-out out of the equation for the sake of "Saving Money"....I'm still not sure exactly what "Saving Money" is, but my wife says we need to do it /s. 

<b>Description</b><br/>
This program generates a weekly meal plan Sunday-Saturday (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner). My idea is to store meals inside SQLite and have the program pull data from the db to create the weekly plan.

<b>Additional features will be added:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Specific meal requests on certain days</li>
  <li>Scape web for new recipes</li>
  <li>Give option to select days for "quick meals"</li>
  <li>Output grocery ingrediant list at end of program</li>
 </ul>


 This is my first program outside of classroom work so although this may seem basic, it is a first step in the right direction for me!
